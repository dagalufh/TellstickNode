Fixed an issue causing Watchers to not be created unless AutoRemote was checked.
Fixed an issue that crashed the application if autoremote was selected but no key/password was configured.
Fixed redirect after creating new schedules.

Version : 1.0.11.1
Bugfix.

Version : 1.0.11
Changed the design of the menu, the home page now contains less information to ease the eyes.
Devicegroups has been implemented!
- This is a way to create a custom device that contains other devices. Allowing you do send commands to multiple at one go.
- The devicegroups can have schedules just as normal devices. They can however not have watches connected to them.
Also changed to that it now verifies if sqlite3 has been installed and if it can be used for session storage. Otherwise it will fall back on session-file-store.

Version : 1.0.10
Switched from using session-file-store to Connect-Session-Knex, a sqlite3 session storage.
This should resolve the error that could occur when restarting.

Version : 1.0.9
Fully implemented Watchers.
- This means you can set a watch on a device, so that when it changes state, it automatically changes back after x minutes.
- There is also the option to have the automatic revert of the status to also trigger a AutoRemote message.
Changed so that even direct-commands for turning a device on/off is done using doubletap function.

Version : 1.0.8
Corrected an issue that caused Timers to turn on again after the off command if doubletap was configured.

Version : 1.0.7
Modified the view of schedule info, now showing correct info in a good way.
Modified the 'View Log' page. You can now click on the refered scheduleid to see that scheduleinfo.
The above is valid for example on: "Resetting "Example Device" to On as stated by schedule with id: 1432834253638"
Added 'Green' theme, available to switch to in Options.

Version : 1.0.6
Added the ability to use sunrise/sundown as a controller even for the interval modifier.
When clicking on a schedule on "Home" page in the Schedules/Timers list (Not schedules by day), a infobox shows about the schedule.

Version : 1.0.3
Corrected debug output
Added option to control if dim button should be shown or not. (option not implemented, forced to false at this time)

Version : 1.0.2
Implemented another try to fix the missed trigger. Think it was related to recalculates moving schedule to the past.
Also implemented some color feedback for active status on the device. And started implementing for DIM. However, need feedback from users having DIM..

Version : 1.0.1
Implemented a possible fix for the missed trigger. The clock was drifting, might solve it now that it dosn't.

Version : 1.0.0
This is the starting point. The application is fully functional.
So from hereon there will be a changelog update for each push.

Working now:
Creating/Removing/Editing schedules
Controllers can be either specific time, sun dependent or as a timer.
Modifiers can be random or based on weather or interval.
Run-once can be enforced.
Auto-Remote messages can be triggered on schedule event.
