Version : 1.0.10
Switched from using session-file-store to Connect-Session-Knex, a sqlite3 session storage.
This should resolve the error that could occur when restarting.

Version : 1.0.9
Fully implemented Watchers.
- This means you can set a watch on a device, so that when it changes state, it automatically changes back after x minutes.
- There is also the option to have the automatic revert of the status to also trigger a AutoRemote message.
Changed so that even direct-commands for turning a device on/off is done using doubletap function.

Version : 1.0.8
Corrected an issue that caused Timers to turn on again after the off command if doubletap was configured.

Version : 1.0.7
Modified the view of schedule info, now showing correct info in a good way.
Modified the 'View Log' page. You can now click on the refered scheduleid to see that scheduleinfo.
The above is valid for example on: "Resetting "Example Device" to On as stated by schedule with id: 1432834253638"
Added 'Green' theme, available to switch to in Options.

Version : 1.0.6
Added the ability to use sunrise/sundown as a controller even for the interval modifier.
When clicking on a schedule on "Home" page in the Schedules/Timers list (Not schedules by day), a infobox shows about the schedule.

Version : 1.0.5
Made another theme for the application, a blue more friendly theme.
Made the output of the log page a bit nicer to read.
Sorted out some other graphical glitches.
Added display of changelog in the log view.
Also added versionnumber to title of application.

Version : 1.0.4
Added function to reset devices on command from browser.
    This is to enable users to reset them after paused schedules.
Some minor GUI tweaks on the Home screen.

Version : 1.0.3
Corrected debug output
Added option to control if dim button should be shown or not. (option not implemented, forced to false at this time)

Version : 1.0.2
Implemented another try to fix the missed trigger. Think it was related to recalculates moving schedule to the past.
Also implemented some color feedback for active status on the device. And started implementing for DIM. However, need feedback from users having DIM..

Version : 1.0.1
Implemented a possible fix for the missed trigger. The clock was drifting, might solve it now that it dosn't.

Version : 1.0.0
This is the starting point. The application is fully functional.
So from hereon there will be a changelog update for each push.

Working now:
Creating/Removing/Editing schedules
Controllers can be either specific time, sun dependent or as a timer.
Modifiers can be random or based on weather or interval.
Run-once can be enforced.
